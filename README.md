# Accelerated Raytracer

A GPU Accelerated Raytracer. Not even in Alpha yet.

## Changes From The [Last Raytracer][https://github.com/DonIsaac/Raytrace-Renderer]
1. Improved workflow
2. GPU acceleration
3. Improved math classes
## Why is this in Java?

A couple of reasons:
1) I am the most familiar with Java
2) Because of the JIT compiler optimizations, Java programs can run as fast, if not faster, than C++ programs
3) Java is great for UI stuff
